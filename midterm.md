**Turtlerun**
The turtle run is a game where a newborn turtle must reach the sea before he gets caught by a seagull. The only thing is, he must figure out how to move forward! 

by pressing the combination: Down, up, left, right, you will move forward, otherwise, you will go backwards, to the seagull!

Can you reach the sea before the seagull reaches you?

What still needs to be done:

- Add images and sounds
- Add arduino controlls to it


**ThingsYouLove**
This is a little game on which you can add 5 favorite words you love about the HKU. You can then pass it on by your friend (Called partner) to let him try to guess the words. 

- Whats still needs to be done:
- Add better text
- Make the 5 words player 1 typed appear in a different order so that the game is about guessing the right combination instead of words (because it can be everything)
- I have a strange bug when showing my score on the end??
